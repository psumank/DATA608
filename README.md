## DATA608 - Course Project

This project is completed as part of CUNY DATA 608's curriculum. The intent of the project is to visualize the state level summary of fatalities caused by various weather events in USA. And also, provide the county level impacts (both fatalities as well as the financial damages to crops and properties) in the State of Arkansas, in the years - 2015 and 2014.
